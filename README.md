Deins allows you to track your feelings about different areas of your life by regularily adding pearls to a chain and painting them. The more a pearl is painted, the better you feel. You can then get a chart of your feelings over time, represented by the percentages of the shapes that are painted.



It is written in Flutter / Dart and open source. This is my first attempt at creating a Flutter app, so please don't judge me by my coding style :-)
